This project is intended to feature predictive analysis using the caret library. I want to add another column to person ordering when they submitted their surveys from first to last, and possbly gain some insight as to factors that contribute to a person's submission time.
As always, we need to pick our tools:
```{R, results='hide', message=FALSE}
  include <- function(library_name){
    if( !(library_name %in% installed.packages()) )
      install.packages(library_name) 
    library(library_name, character.only=TRUE)
  }
include("caret")
include("dplyr")
include("tidyr")
include("tidyverse")
include("knitr")
#purl("Music Insights.Rmd", output = "part1.r")
#source("part1.r")
```
With that out of the way, we can go ahead and do the important stuff.

One of the most effective ways of gathering insight about the change in a variable is by seeing how well it correlates with another one. In this case, we're seeing how well the target variable, time_submitted, correlates with every other variable. A larger value means a higher correlation.
```{R}
submission_model <- lm(data=person, formula = as.Date(person$time_submitted) ~ person$sex + person$year_born + person$academic_level + person$academic_major)
submission_model
```
As we can see from these results, none of the variables correlate exceptionally well, with academic major being the strongest negative correlation. 

```{R}
#sample_selection = createDataPartition(person$time_submitted, p = 0.70, list = FALSE)
#train <- person[sample_selection, ]
#test <- person[-sample_selection, ]
```
I was unable to get line 34 to work with an error "Error in names(dn) <- dnn : 'names' attribute [44] must be the same length as the vector [9]"
